All of these capabilities are added directly to your Wordpress admin console.  No additional software, service or hosting is required.  All data is stored securely in the same database that holds your WooCommerce data.  No data is stored off-site. 

Profitori is intuitive and easy to use, with clean uncluttered screens and a consistent experience throughout the plugin.

Profitori has a very small footprint on your server, as most of the work is done on the client machine inside the browser.  Profitori uses modern client-side technologies such as ReactJS for almost all of its functionality.

Profitori is fast due to its unique architecture.  Data is cached on the client wherever possible, minimizing network traffic and load on the database.

Profitori is robust due to our "test first" philosophy.  All features were developed using a Functional Test-Driven Approach.  This has resulted in a solid core of features that have been, and will continue to be, tested many times, far more than can be achieved with manual testing.

Profitori has been built from the ground up with ease-of-extension in mind.  Contact us via Support for enhancements - you will be surprised at how quickly and efficiently these can be delivered.
